# Cost to Serve Proof of Concept

This repository contains a minimal [Reflex](https://github.com/reflex-dev/reflex) web application used as a proof of concept for simulating logistic costs.

## Development setup

1. Install the Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   reflex run
   ```
   The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

The app currently displays a simple "Hello, World!" page as a starting point for future development.
